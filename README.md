# discord-bot

Discord bot with functionality to play "Heads Up" and supports a currency ecosystem. Uses Discord's API to utilize the command handler; once loading the commands, typing a "/" into the Discord chat should prompt the user for commands from this bot. Intended to be implemented into Replit for cloud-based operation to avoid local dependency.
